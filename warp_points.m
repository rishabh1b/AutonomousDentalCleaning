function [ warped_pts ] = warp_points( H, sample_pts)

% warp_pts uses the homography to warp the

%points in sample_pts to points in the logo image

% Inputs:

%     video_pts: a 4x2 matrix of (x,y) coordinates of corners in the

%         video frame

%     logo_pts: a 4x2 matrix of (x,y) coordinates of corners in

%         the logo image

%     sample_pts: a nx2 matrix of (x,y) coordinates of points in the video

%         video that need to be warped to corresponding points in the

%         logo image

% Outputs:

%     warped_pts: a nx2 matrix of (x,y) coordinates of points obtained

%         after warping the sample_pts
